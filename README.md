# The Source Taster

The Source Taster is a browser extension that helps users, especially students and researchers, quickly and efficiently verify the validity and existence of sources cited in academic papers.

## Why?

The Source Taster is necessary because there is an increasing prevalence of literature that is generated by artificial intelligence, which often cites sources that do not actually exist. This growing issue poses a significant challenge for students and researchers who rely on accurate and verifiable references for their academic work.

## How?

1. **Insert Citations:** Users can copy and paste the entire bibliography of their academic paper into the plugin.
2. **Data Verification:** The plugin cross-references the entered citations (DOIs) with databases such as CrossRef.
3. **Report Generation:** Users receive a comprehensive report on the citations. The report highlights which sources were successfully verified and identifies those that are potentially incorrect or non-existent.
