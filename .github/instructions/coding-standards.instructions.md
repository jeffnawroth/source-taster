# GitHub Copilot Coding Standards Instructions

## Code Writing Standards

- Follow established code-writing standards for your language (spacing, comments, naming).
- Extend standards with internal rules for folder and function naming if needed.

## Comment Usage

- Use comments sparingly and only when meaningful.
- Avoid commenting on obvious code; focus on explaining "why" and potential pitfalls.

## Conditional Encapsulation

- Encapsulate nested if/else logic into functions with descriptive names for clarity.

## DRY Principle

- Avoid code duplication; reuse code via functions, classes, modules, or libraries.
- Modify code in one place when updating logic.

## Function Length & Responsibility

- Write short, focused functions (single responsibility principle).
- Break up long or complex functions into smaller ones.

## General Code Style & Readability

- Write code that is readable, understandable, and maintainable.
- Prioritize clarity and adhere to coding standards.
- Regularly review and refactor code for structure and maintainability.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration.

## Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Names should reflect purpose, behavior, and usage.
- Prefer specific names that reveal intent without needing comments.
